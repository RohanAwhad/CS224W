# Stanford CS224W Machine Learning with Graphs

## Solved jupyter notebooks from CS224W class

I am currently going through the video lecture series, as well as the recommended reading. The course page lists when each jupyter notebook is released, and similarly homework assignments. As I have completed the recommended reading and lecture I will be completing the assignments, along with the notebooks. I can share the notebooks here, but I cannot publicly share the homework assignments, as it is a [Honor Code Violation](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/info.html).
